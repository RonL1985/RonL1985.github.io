		<h1>Elevator Pitch:</h1> <p>Hi, my name is Ronald Luna I am currently a developer at CNM Deep Dive FullStack
		Development BootCamp in order to expand my skill set and acquire practical experience.
		I am doing this in hopes of one day being successful in a career that will take me places in life and make life
		better for my kids and I with a stable career in programming and coding. Would you be interested in hearing more?</p>
		<h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
		<p>I have learned a lot more then I knew before I entered into the Deep Dive Coding BootCamp.
		I am anxious to know what else I can learn a achieve as the BootCamp continues. Visiting Fatpipe was a good
		experience to have. It motivated me to keep doing my best in BootCamp to achieve my goal of one day having a real
		good job that I can depend on in the future.</p>
		<h1>Week 2 Reflection</h1>
		<p>Week Two was a real challenge for me I have learn a lot of things about coding and enjoy doing it. I have learned a lot
		from the class studies. Watching the presentation at the UNM campus was a great thing to watch. It taught me how i should do my
		own presentation for my Capstone project. I am confident that I will make a good presentation.</p>

		<h1>Week Three</h1>
		<h3>Internet research on Ronald Joe Luna</h3>
		<img src="img/graph.jpg">
		<p>I did the search on Google.com/google.search and yahoo.com.
			Did not find much just personal information
		and thing about my life and family.
			Also showed some old photos of myself when i was younger.
			It showed my old address as well so they must not keep up to date with history on people.</p>
