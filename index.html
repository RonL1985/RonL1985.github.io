		<h1>Golden Circle</h1>
		<img src="img/Golden-Circle.jpg">
		<h1>Project Description:</h1> <P>A passion project that I always considered doing after I have
		acquired the proper skills for. Is creating a unique WebSite for my parents business. And being able to build
		WebSites for many different companies. And to see what new experiences I can have in life with my new skills.</P>
		<h1>Elevator Pitch:</h1> <p>Hi, my name is Ronald Luna I am currently a developer at CNM Deep Dive FullStack
		Development BootCamp in order to expand my skill set and acquire practical experience.
		I am doing this in hopes of one day being successful in a career that will take me places in life and make life
		better for my kids and I with a stable career in programming and coding. Would you be interested in hearing more?</p>
		<h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
		<p>I have learned a lot more then I knew before I entered into the Deep Dive Coding BootCamp.
		I am anxious to know what else I can learn a achieve as the BootCamp continues. Visiting Fatpipe was a good
		experience to have. It motivated me to keep doing my best in BootCamp to achieve my goal of one day having a real
		good job that I can depend on in the future.</p>
		<h1>Week Two Reflection</h1>
		<p>Week Two was a real challenge for me I have learn a lot of things about coding and enjoy doing it. I have learned a lot
		from the class studies. Watching the presentation at the UNM campus was a great thing to watch. It taught me how i should do my
		own presentation for my Capstone project. I am confident that I will make a good presentation.</p>

		<h2>Week Three Reflection</h2>
		<p>It was a great week I learned a lot. I think I am doing good work and I am only going to get better. Friday we had guest speakers
		it was a good experience to listen to. I learned things I did not know about like the internet is bigger then the WorldWildWeb and I also did
		not know that you could play music threw code. That was a neat thing to watch and learn. Digital Media was very interesting but I don't know if that is
		something I would want to do for a career. But all and all I enjoyed every guest speaker.</p>

		<h1>Week Three</h1>
		<h3>Internet research on Ronald Joe Luna</h3>
		<img src="img/graph.jpg">
		<p>I did the search on Google.com/google.search and yahoo.com.
			Did not find much just personal information
		and thing about my life and family.
			Also showed some old photos of myself when i was younger.
			It showed my old address as well so they must not keep up to date with history on people.</p>

	<p>I am on a path like a maze tying to find my way through life trying not to run into any holes in the road.
		I alway seem to find my way around the hard obstacles and get on the right path heading to success. Becoming the
	Man I was Destined to become and see a bright new future in front of ME. </p>

		<h1>How do you identify professionally? What do you want to be known for?</h1>
		<p>I want to be seen as a full stack developer being able to do what full stack stands for. Frontend, Backend, and Design.
		And always completing project that I take on.</p>

	<h1>Team Work Forbidden Island</h1>
		<ul>
			<li id="itme1">Team work should be always making decisions together to ensure success.</li>
			<li id="itme2">One wrong move can lead you the wrong way and cause confusion.</li>
			<li id="itme3">When you can't make a decision. Asking your team mates can always get that decision easier to make because you have
			there take on it.</li>
			<li id="item0">If I had a choice to work alone on a hard project or with a team? I would always chose the team because
			having a teams help would most likely ensure the projects success.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>MeetUp With Team</h1>
		<p>My team met up for lunch at Filling Philly's. We all discussed what all needs to be done with our capstone project.
		And what would be the best way going by doing it the right way and that if we needed help just to ask. I think I have a great
		team and I think we will accomplish this capstone project and it will turn out great.</p>
