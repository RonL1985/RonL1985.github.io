		<h1>Elevator Pitch:</h1> <p>Hi, my name is Ronald Luna I am currently a developer at CNM Deep Dive FullStack
		Development BootCamp in order to expand my skill set and acquire practical experience.
		I am doing this in hopes of one day being successful in a career that will take me places in life and make life
		better for my kids and I with a stable career in programming and coding. Would you be interested in hearing more?</p>

		<h1 align="center">Beginning Of Reflection</h1>

		<h2>Week One Reflection</h2>
		<p>I have learned a lot more then I knew before I entered into the Deep Dive Coding BootCamp.
		I am anxious to know what else I can learn a achieve as the BootCamp continues. Visiting Fatpipe was a good
		experience to have. It motivated me to keep doing my best in BootCamp to achieve my goal of one day having a real
		good job that I can depend on in the future.</p>

		<h1>Week Two Reflection</h1>
		<p>Week Two was a real challenge for me I have learn a lot of things about coding and enjoy doing it. I have learned a lot
		from the class studies. Watching the presentation at the UNM campus was a great thing to watch. It taught me how i should do my
		own presentation for my Capstone project. I am confident that I will make a good presentation.</p>

		<h2>Week Three Reflection</h2>
		<p>It was a great week I learned a lot. I think I am doing good work and I am only going to get better. Friday we had guest speakers
		it was a good experience to listen to. I learned things I did not know about like the internet is bigger then the WorldWildWeb and I also did
		not know that you could play music threw code. That was a neat thing to watch and learn. Digital Media was very interesting but I don't know if that is
		something I would want to do for a career. But all and all I enjoyed every guest speaker.</p>

		<h2>Week Four Reflection</h2>
		<p>Playing Forbidden Island was fun as a group. I learned a lot about how a team should work together to get things done right.
		I met up with my CapStone team for lunch to discuss thing out about our capstone project and what needs to be done and how we could help each other out wit it.
		We also made are team guidelines which is good to have because it helps the team understand better.
		Friday we had guest speakers. It was nice to hear them. Made me think about what to kind of expect after boot camp and I learned something new about imposter syndrome never
		new there was such a thing. So it was neat to here about that.</p>

		<h2>Week Five Reflection</h2>
		<p>Week five was a challenge but fun and educational. Worked a lot with my capstone team on getting classes and unit testing
		done. The guest speakers for friday were great to listen to. I seem to find out new things I did not even know you could do which is pretty neat.</p>

		<h2>Week Six Reflection</h2>
		<p>Week Six felt really long but full of new things to learn and do. I did not get the chance to attend the Deep Dive Field Trip Wed 20th due to
		things that have happened in this thing we call life my car was stolen. but other then that the week was great. Had a lot on my plate to get done
		I am just hopping that everything that I have got done is good to keep moving forward. The three guest speakers we had for friday was a great experience
		it feels good knowing that there is a lot of help out there to help us find a good job after this is all done. Just waiting for that next chapter in my life
		to come.</p>

		<h2>Week Seven Reflection</h2>
		<p>Week seven was a lot of hard work but learned a lot from the instructors and from my capstone team. The guest speakers for friday were
		very interesting I learn more with each passing day can't wait to graduate and start doing this as a career.</p>

		<h2>Week Eight Reflection</h2>
		<p>Week eight was a great week. I got my pwp done and up and running. I am learning so much from this bootcamp more then I
		have ever known. The interviews on friday went pretty good. I was a little nerves but there was no need for that. I did better
		then I thought I would. Now I am just concentrating on my capstone and so far everything is turning out great.</p>

		<h2>Week Nine Reflection</h2>
		<p>Week nine was a lot of hard work with the capstone project. We got a lot done and I think it is going to turn out great.
		Friday's guest speaker was great to listen to. I seem to learn something new with each Guest speaker we have every week.
		now onto the last week of class. I am nerves but excited I will miss coming to this class and hanging out with the people
		from class that are like friends now. So I hope the best for everyone in this class and hope there futures go the way they want it to.</p>
