		better for my kids and I with a stable career in programming and coding. Would you be interested in hearing more?</p>
		<h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
		<p>I have learned a lot more then I knew before I entered into the Deep Dive Coding BootCamp.
		I am anxious to know what else I can learn a achieve as the BootCamp continues. Visiting Fatpipe was a good
		experience to have. It motivated me to keep doing my best in BootCamp to achieve my goal of one day having a real
		good job that I can depend on in the future.</p>
